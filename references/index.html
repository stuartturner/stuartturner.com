#### Scrum Mastery

#### Software Quality
Tools that create an automation script by recording use of a product are testing an implementation and tend to cost you more when you want to change your implementation.  
Learning how to write tests that focus on the intent of what your product should do can (and should) be written BEFORE the implementation.  
Some FREE testing and quality assessment tools that allow you to do that are here. They are all being continously improved.
